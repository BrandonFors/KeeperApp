Initially created as part of a React course but I have now added aditional functionality as well as an Node/Express backend with a PostgreSQL database. Users can create, edit, and delete notes. If the user is logged in, these notes are stored and modified within a PostgreSQL database. If notes are created when not logged in and the user logs in, created notes will be added to the database.
